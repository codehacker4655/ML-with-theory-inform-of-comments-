# ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning Algorithm Colab Notebook
#
# ðŸ“– About:
# This notebook contains both the *code* and the *theory* for
# the selected Machine Learning algorithm â€” explained in **simple,
# beginner-friendly comments**.
#
# ðŸ’¡ How to Use:
# 1. Read the comments carefully â€” they explain every step of the
#    code, including the math logic, model parameters, and workflow.
# 2. Run each code cell one-by-one to see the algorithm in action.
# 3. Decode the comments like a step-by-step guide; everything is
#    written as if I am teaching you in class.
#
# ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
# If you read the comments and execute the code, you should be able
# to:
#    - Understand the theory behind the algorithm
#    - See how the training process happens
#    - Interpret the outputs and evaluation metrics
#    - Connect the math to the code implementation
#
# ðŸ›  Structure:
#    - Dataset creation / loading
#    - Data preprocessing
#    - Model creation & training
#    - Predictions
#    - Evaluation (with explanations)
#
# ðŸš€ Tip:
# Treat each notebook as a *self-learning module*. By the end,
# youâ€™ll not only know how to use the algorithm in Python, but also
# understand WHY and HOW it works.
